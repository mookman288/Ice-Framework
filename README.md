#Ice Framework
##PxO Ink

The Ice Framework is a modifiable and reusable system that can provide a basic structure for implementing fluid and accessible 
websites. This framework isn't designed to provide the most compelling aesthetic experience. Nor is it designed to standardize 
the web. Instead, utilizing the Ice Framework should provide a clean and scalable experience that delivers DOM content 
quickly, and then focuses on displaying it in a way that users can appreciate, but not be overwhelmed by.

###Origins

Building the Ice Framework serves a collection of purposes to: 

* Better understand the difficulties and benefits of building and supporting a web design framework. 
* Freshen up on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript / jQuery.
* Explore and be introduced to Require, Node, Gulp, and the benefits of task running. 
* Explore the possibility of creating a unique framework concept, and methods that may improve website experiences. 
* Become more familiar with modern website technology and design aesthetic.
* To have a little fun!

###Installation

ce Framework comes packaged compiled and compressed for implementation. Besides fonts, there are only three additional files 
that need to be included on each page to load Ice Framework. The following table explains what these files are and where they 
should be located.

| Name          | File Location         | HTML Location                   | Notes                                           |
|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Modernizr     | `js/modernizr.min.js` | Right before the closing `head` | Optional, but highly recommended                |
| Framework CSS | `css/stylesheet.css`  | In the `head`                   | Load before any render blocking JavaScript      |
| Framework JS  | `js/framework.js`     | Right before the closing `body` | Required for JavaScript implementations to work |
